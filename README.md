# flutterstringprocessor

<p> The following program is a string processor built using Flutter. </p>
<p> This program will take in a string, process it to make each word selectable, and can retrieve its corresponding definition by querying a local JSON file. </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Users can select a word by tapping on it to highlight, and tap again to reveal a definition. </li>
  <li> Users can unselect a highlighted word by tapping it again or holding on the word. </li>
    </ul>

<p> Future implementations would include saving certain words and writing to the database, hearing pronounciations, creating semantics so that the program can identify names/ locations, and being able to select from a list of multiple strings to read beforehand. </p>
